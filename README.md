# GasUnitTestingFramework: Google Apps Script Unit Testing Framework

## Introduction

GasUnitTestingFramework is a unitary test Framework dedicated to Google Apps Script (GAS)

It can run online in the Google Apps Script environnement (IDE) as well as offline on your computer from your IDE.

It is inspired from [UnitTestingApp](https://github.com/WildH0g/UnitTestingApp) project and also
from some other that can be found [here](https://github.com/contributorpw/google-apps-script-awesome-list#testing).

Some enhance will be added in future release, trying to take the best of each project.

## How to Install

You can install it by:
 - importing it as a GAS library ([this is not the best way for performance, must be avoid in UI project](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/support/best-practices#avoid_libraries_in_ui-heavy_scripts))
 - importing it as a git submodule inside your GAS git project (the best way to keep update easy, and to choose which files will be sent to your appscript project)
 - copying GasUnitTestingFrameworks.js file to your project
